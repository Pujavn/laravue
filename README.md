# Vue 3 with Laravel 8 Project

## Introduction
This is a full-stack web application built using **Vue.js 3** for the front-end and **Laravel 8** for the back-end. It combines the power of Vue for a reactive and modern user interface and Laravel's robust back-end capabilities for handling business logic, authentication, and API handling.

## Technologies Used
- **Vue.js 3**: For building reactive and modular front-end components.
- **Laravel 8**: For providing a powerful back-end, handling routing, models, and database interactions.
- **MySQL** (or any other database): Used as the database engine (you can specify your own).
- **API Routes**: Built-in with Laravel to handle API requests for the Vue front-end.

## Project Setup

### Prerequisites
- **PHP** >= 7.3 (for Laravel)
- **Composer** (to manage Laravel dependencies)
- **Node.js** >= 12 (for Vue and Laravel Mix)
- **npm** (Node package manager)

### Step 1: Clone the repository
To get a copy of the project locally, clone this repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git


cd your-repo-name
composer install
npm install
cp .env.example .env
php artisan key:generate
php artisan migrate
php artisan serve
npm run dev

For production, you can compile the front-end assets by running:
npm run build
